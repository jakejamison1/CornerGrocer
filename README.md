# Corner-Grocer app is an app created in C++ for school. 

# When creating project be sure all files are saved in same directory
# In order for file to work the input.txt file has to be created and put in folder with source.cpp

# This app sorts a list of items and counts their frequency and also creates a histogram. 
I used a good mix of python and C++ when I created this file.  I could have done a better job
of using C++ more rather than running a lot through Python. C++ being the faster language it would
improve the speed had this been a larger program. I had issues making the functions work correctly with C++
which is why I used python to do a lot of the work. I alse had a problem figuring out where to put the 
files in the directory due to relying on Python heavily. I just kept trying things and pushing through to 
overcome it. The combination of 2 languages is hard but interesting so I would enjoy trying this again 
in later projects. I tried to keep this program compact with functions and Python is very readable so 
it helps keep this readable.
